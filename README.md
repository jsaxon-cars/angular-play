Playground for Angular Research and Learning
============================================

This is a repo which started as a Yeoman generator-angular project. 

The purpose is to learn about AngularJS and focus on understanding how to implement the NewCars Quote Path using only RESTful services to communicate the quote path. 

So far it's been tweeked to break out the pieces into DRY and has a global nav element in the controller.

There were two controllers, but I couldn't get that to operate as I wanted.

I would think the nav controller would be different from the other controller currently called "main" but I don't yet.

I am working with route paths, though for what I'm intending there may be none of that at all.  Everything might be controlled without any route changes at all.
